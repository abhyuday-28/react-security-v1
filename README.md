# System-Level Rootkit Detection

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the static analysis of system-level files to detect operational rootkits, malicious software designed to gain unauthorized access and control over a computer system. The primary goal is to enhance early detection and mitigation efforts by identifying indicators of rootkit presence within system files. This is achieved through a combination of memory analysis, code signatures, and SHA verifications.

## Introduction

Operational rootkits pose a significant threat to system security, and timely detection is crucial. This project employs a multi-faceted approach that includes memory analysis, code signatures, and SHA verifications to identify rootkit indicators within system files. By examining file integrity, permissions, and anomalous patterns, the project aims to bolster early detection efforts and enhance system security.

## Features

- **Static Analysis**: The project utilizes memory analysis, code signatures, and SHA verifications to identify potential rootkit indicators within system files.

- **File Integrity Checks**: It includes mechanisms for verifying the integrity of critical system files to detect any unauthorized modifications.

- **Permissions Analysis**: The project examines file permissions to identify unauthorized changes or access.

- **Anomaly Detection**: The system is designed to recognize and flag anomalous patterns within system files.

## How it Works

The project employs a combination of memory analysis, code signature checks, and SHA verifications to statically analyze commonly infected files. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

- **Memory Analysis**: The system conducts memory analysis to identify suspicious processes or memory regions associated with rootkit activity.

- **Code Signatures**: It checks files for known rootkit code signatures, helping to detect well-known rootkit patterns.

- **SHA Verifications**: SHA verifications are used to ensure the integrity of system files by comparing their checksums with trusted values.
